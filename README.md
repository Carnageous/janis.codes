# How I code
As most programmers do, I try to find the perfect mix of using modern technology and mastering things I know.

For the first 3 years of my web-experience I built websites without using any javascript framework.
In the moment I build websites for clients primarily using Vue.js and with Angular at my full-time job at SMS group in Germany.

At the Research and Development department of SMS group I'm combining our Physical models with Python and Web-technologies to bring steel production to a new level.
Predicting characteristics of steel or analysing plant and machine data are just a few examples of our work.
